`XBeeArduino` is an Arduino-friendly C++ wrapper for the [xbee_c_library](https://github.com/felixgalindo/xbee_c_library), providing a simplified interface for integrating XBee modules into Arduino projects.

## Features
- Easy-to-use C++ interface for XBee modules
- Compatible with Arduino platforms
- Uses the `xbee_c_library` as a submodule

## Installation
1. Clone the repository with its submodule:

   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/your-username/XBeeArduino.git
   ```

2. Include the `XBeeArduino` header and source files in your Arduino project.
